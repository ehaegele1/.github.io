This project was harder than expected just because of the problems I had with Ajax.
I had an original project and finished the entire thing just to figure out that the API did not work.
I then had to create a more basic assignment which was when I created flix.
Once i had the layout of the site it was easy. I just had to replace some of the features and update the content.
I added a carousel pretty easily and pretty much everything else was easy once I got past the Ajax issues.
Youtube and google were a big help to me. My research answered a lot of questions and fixed multiple bugs that I encountered.
